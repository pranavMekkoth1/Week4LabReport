2. [Link to test file for failure-inducing input](https://github.com/pranavMekkoth1/markdown-parse/edit/main/nolinks.md)

  **Note**: the failure inducing input was when there was no links in the file.

3. output of running the file at command line at this time:

4. The bug in the code was that the program didn't account for if there was no brackets or sets of parenthesis to designate links. This resulted in the error the symptom that was the infinite loop that ran when we ran the java commands in the terminal. To fix the issue, we used the an if statment to specify the special case (as seen in item 1 on this list).
